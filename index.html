    <h2>Ways To Get Involved</h2>
    <p>
    Finding charities and organizations that align with your beliefs is helpful. 
    One that I (Aster) enjoy working with is <a href=https://www.rainbowcollectiveforchange.org/>Rainbow Collective For Change</a>. 
    They specialize in queer and trans youth, and they put together events for queer joy, protests, and reading events. 
    They have paid positions, volunteer positions, and opportunities to read to children. 
    Getting involved in school clubs and communities is another way for those under the voting age to actively participate in politics. 
    Educating yourself on political affairs iis also very important to be an informed citizen.
